# Message Passing; Belief propagation algrithm

From graphical mode, create cluster graph.

Initialize with factors.

Start with uninformative message

Def: **cluster graph** an undirected gaph 

- the nodes are $C_i \subseteq \{X_1, \ldots, X_n\}$ with the $X_i$ nodes of
  the original graph, and
- an edge is associated with setsep $S_{i,j} \subseteq X_i \cap X_j$.

Given a set of factors $\Phi$ assign each $\phi_k \in \Phi$ to a cluster
$C_{\alpha(k)}$ s.t. $\mathrm{Scope}(\phi_k) \subseteq C_{\alpha(k)}$.

- Need every bit of evidence taken into account, hence every factor needs to
  be in at least one cluster,
- but also need every bit of evidence to be taken into account only once (o/w
  I tell you a rumour, and then believe it more when you tell it back to me),
  hence assign to at most one cluster.
- a cluster can have multiple factors assigned to it.

Def: the initial potential of the cluster

   $$\psi_i(C_i) = \prod_{k: \alpha(k) = i} \phi_k$$ 

Def: the messages are of the form
   $$\delta_{i \rightarrow j}(S_{i,j}) =
      \sum_{C_i \setminus S_{i,j}}\psi_i
        \prod_{k \in \mathcal{N}_i -\{j\}} \delta_{k \rightarrow i}$$

Belief propagation algorithm now repeats:

- choose an edge
- pass the message along that edge

Finally compute

   $$\beta_i(C_i) = \psi_i \prod_{k \in \mathcal{N}_i} \delta_{k \rightarrow i}$$

- repeat until when?
- how to select edges?
- in general this is an approximate solution.

# Cluster Graph Properties

Family preservation: for very factor $\phi$ there is a cluster $C_i$ with
$\mathrm{Scope}(\phi) \subseteq C_i$.

Running intersection property: for each pair of cluster $C_i, C_j$ and $X \in
C_i \cap C_j$ there is a unique path between $C_i$ and $C_j$ for which all
clusters and sepsets contain $X$.

- existence so that there can not be isolated parts of the graph with information
  about $X$ that don't pass messages about $X$.
- uniqueness needed so that a belief doesn't reinforce itself by having a
  self reinforcing loop.

Note: if $X$ and $Y$ are very correlated we can still have things that are
close to such loops.  This is one of the problems with belief propagation.

RIP is equivalent to the statement that for any $X$ the set of clusters and
sepsets that contain $X$ form a tree.

TODO: implement message passing; create example where RIP failing causes a
problem.

## Bethe Cluster Graph

Often used, but in some sense degenerate.

- big clusters: $C_i = \mathrm{Scope}(\phi_i)$ for each factor $\phi_i$.
- little cluster: for each variable $X_i$ a cluster $\{X_i\}$.
- edge: $C_k \leftrightarrow X_i$ iff $X_i \in C_k$.

Always bipartite.  No information passed about correlations between variables.

## Properties of belief propagation

A cluster graph is **calibrated** iff every pair of adjacent clusters $C_i, C_j$
agree on the belief about their sepset $S_{i,j}$:

   $$\sum_{C_i \setminus S_{i,j}} \beta_i(C_i) =
      \sum_{C_j \setminus S_{i,j}} \beta_j(C_j)$$

Convergence of the algorithm (message is the same as the previous message)
implies calibration.
  $$\mu_{i,j} = \delta_{i \rightarrow j} \delta_{j \rightarrow i} =
     \sum_{C_j \setminus S_{i,j}} \beta_j $$

Reparametrization; by doing the message passing algorithm, no information
has been lost

  $$ \frac{\prod \beta_i}{\prod \mu_{i,j}} = \tilde{P}$$
  
remember $\tilde{P}$ is the original unnormalized measure (product of the
factors); see this from the fact every message appears once in a $\beta_i$ and
once in a $\mu_{i,j}$, and every factor appears once is a $\beta_i$.
